# FAR.AI Comms Style Guide — Twitter / Bluesky Threads

## Structure
- **Tweet 1**:  
  - Strong hook  
  - Compressed summary of findings to fill 280-char tweet
  - End with 👇

- **Tweet 2**:  
  - ▶️ Watch {event_name} recording: {video_url}  
  - 📄 Read paper: {resource_url}

## Formatting Instructions
- Output both tweets separated by a line containing only `---`
- Do **not** include labels like “Tweet 1:” or “Tweet 2:”
- Do **not** wrap tweets in quotation marks

## Style Notes
- Max: **280 characters per tweet**
- No hashtags or em dashes
- Audience: ML researchers and technical readers
- Use:
  - Metrics
  - Surprising results
  - Novel methods
- Emphasize:
  - Shareability
  - Technical clarity

## Evaluation Rubric (14 points)

## High-Performing Examples

### Example 1: [Add title here]
```
"High-compute alignment is necessary for safe superintelligence."
@polynoamial
: integrate alignment into high-compute RL, not after
🔹 3 approaches: adversarial training, scalable oversight, model organisms
🔹 Process: train robust models → align during RL → monitor deployment

```

### Example 2: 
```
You cannot really train all these models to cater to different preferences. Can you have one model that caters to all?
