- **Tweet 1**:  
  - Strong hook  
  - Compressed summary of findings to fill 280-char tweet
  - End with üëá

- **Tweet 2**:  
  - ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Watch {event_name} recording: {video_url}  
  - üìÑ Read paper: {resource_url}

## Formatting Instructions
- Output both tweets separated by a line containing only `---`
- Do **not** include labels like ‚ÄúTweet 1:‚Äù or ‚ÄúTweet 2:‚Äù
- Do **not** wrap tweets in quotation marks

## Style Notes
- Max: **280 characters per tweet**
- No hashtags or em dashes
- Audience: ML researchers and technical readers
- Use:
  - Metrics

## High-Performing Examples

### Example 1: [Add title here]
```
"High-compute alignment is necessary for safe superintelligence."
@polynoamial
: integrate alignment into high-compute RL, not after
‚ñ∏ 3 approaches: adversarial training, scalable oversight, model organisms
‚ñ∏ Process: train robust models ‚Üí align during RL ‚Üí monitor deployment

```

### Example 2: 
```
You cannot really train all these models to cater to different preferences. Can you have one model that caters to all?

@furongh unveils a technique to customize AI models on-the-fly to user goals, reducing the computational cost of tailoring AI systems to individual needs.
