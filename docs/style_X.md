# FAR.AI Comms Style Guide — Twitter / Bluesky Threads

## Structure
- Single ultra-dense tweet (≤280 characters)
- Strong hook followed by compressed findings
- Video links and paper references added in post-processing

## Formatting Instructions
- Output single tweet only
- Do **not** include CTAs, video links, or paper references - these are added in post-processing
- Do **not** wrap tweet in quotation marks

## Style Notes
- Max: **280 characters total**
- No hashtags or em dashes
- Audience: ML researchers and technical readers
- Use:
  - Metrics
  - Surprising results
  - Novel methods
- Emphasize:
  - Shareability
  - Technical clarity

## Evaluation Rubric (14 points)

### Content Quality (8 pts)
- **Hook Strength (2)** – Surprising or thought-provoking
- **Evidence Specificity (2)** – Data or technical specificity
- **Clarity (2)** – Understandable, yet sharp
- **Value (2)** – Useful insight or framing

### Style Quality (6 pts)
- **Voice (2)** – Confident and precise
- **Conciseness (2)** – Dense, no fluff
- **Tone (2)** – Clear, non-sensational

## High-Performing Examples

### Example 1: Technical Research Finding
```
"High-compute alignment is necessary for safe superintelligence."
@polynoamial: integrate alignment into high-compute RL, not after
▸ 3 approaches: adversarial training, scalable oversight, model organisms
▸ Process: train robust models → align during RL → monitor deployment
```

### Example 2: Research Innovation
```
You cannot really train all these models to cater to different preferences. Can you have one model that caters to all?

@furongh unveils a technique to customize AI models on-the-fly to user goals, reducing the computational cost of tailoring AI systems to individual needs.
```

## What Makes These Work
- **Ultra-dense information** - Maximum insight per character
- **Technical precision** - Specific methods, results, numbers
- **Strong opening** - Hook grabs attention immediately
- **No wasted words** - Every character adds value
