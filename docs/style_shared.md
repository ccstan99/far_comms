# FAR.AI Comms Style Guide — Shared Principles

These guidelines apply across **all platforms**.

## Voice & Tone
- **Voice**: Smart-colleague — conversational yet authoritative, maximally concise
- **Tone**: Professional and grounded, never speaker mimicry

## Language Rules
- Avoid:
  - Passive voice
  - Overused adverbs
  - Vague or hype-y language

- Do not use:
  - Em dashes (—) or regular hyphens (-) except in hyphenated names — use periods, commas, natural breaks
  - Hashtags (absolutely prohibited - never suggest or include hashtags)
  - Overused adjectives like:
    - "exciting", "groundbreaking", "revealing", "incredible", "eye-opening"

## Content Style
- **Human writing**: Natural and conversational, NOT AI-generated or robotic
- **Accessibility**: Clear and accessible while preserving technical accuracy

## Character Limits
- **Twitter/X**: Tweet 1 must be ≤280 characters
- **LinkedIn**: <150 words total, bullets ≤8 words each

## Emojis
- **LinkedIn**: ▸ 👇 ▶️ 📄 allowed in designated places
- **Twitter/X**: Only 👇 at end of tweet 1

## Content Quality Standards
- **Hook requirements**: Concise, accurate, punchy - NOT sensational or clickbait
- **Writing style**: Natural human conversation - NOT AI-generated or robotic

## Attribution
- Always **credit the speaker and their research**
- Do **not** imply the talk is FAR.AI’s work

## Event Mentioning
- Do **not** frame the event as central
- Mention it **only once**, at the **end CTA**
