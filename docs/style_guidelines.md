# FAR.AI Content Guidelines

Generic content creation guidelines for when specialized crews aren't available.

## Universal Content Principles

### Opening Hooks
- **First 5 words** must grab attention immediately
- **Lead with the finding** - no setup or corporate speak
- **Avoid**: "Researchers discovered that...", "New study shows...", "Framework reveals..."
- **Use**: Direct, surprising, counterintuitive results first
- **Attribution second** - finding first, then who found it

### Content Structure
- **Accessibility first** - explain technical concepts in plain language
- **Business implications** - focus on applications, significance, "so what?"
- **Concrete specifics** - include numbers, metrics, technical details where appropriate
- **Shareability** - content should make the sharer look knowledgeable

### Attribution Format
- **Standard format**: "Name (Affiliation) [verb]..."
- **Examples**: 
  - "Sarah Chen (Stanford AI Lab) found..."
  - "Marcus Rodriguez (Google DeepMind) demonstrated..."
  - "The team at MIT revealed..."

## LinkedIn Content Template

### Structure
1. **Hook** (attention-grabbing opener)
2. **Summary paragraph** (2-3 sentences, business-accessible language)
3. **Key points** (3-4 bullets, ≤8 words each)

### Requirements
- **Audience**: Policymakers, executives, tech professionals (non-ML)
- **Tone**: Professional, conversational, authoritative
- **Length**: <150 words total
- **Bullets**: Complement paragraph, don't repeat
- **Focus**: Implications, applications, broader significance

### Example Structure
```
[Surprising finding that challenges assumptions]

Name (Affiliation) discovered [key finding]. [Technical concept explained simply]. [Why this matters for business/policy decisions].

▸ [Practical implication ≤8 words]
▸ [Business application ≤8 words] 
▸ [Policy significance ≤8 words]
```

## Twitter/X Content Template

### Structure
- **Single tweet** - ultra-dense, every character counts
- **Hook + core content + attribution**

### Requirements
- **Audience**: ML researchers, AI practitioners, technical professionals
- **Tone**: Technical precision, punchy, immediate
- **Length**: Maximize information density within 280 chars
- **Abbreviations**: Use w/, &, numbers not words
- **Focus**: Technical details, methods, surprising results

### Example Structure
```
[Counterintuitive finding] - [Name] (@handle) found [technical detail w/ numbers]. [Method/approach]. [Why this challenges current thinking].
```

## Universal Quality Checklist

## Fallback Content Process

When creating content without specialized crews:

1. **Identify key finding** - What's the most surprising/important insight?
2. **Choose audience** - LinkedIn (business) vs Twitter/X (technical)?
3. **Create hook** - Lead with finding in <5 words
4. **Add attribution** - Use standard "Name (Affiliation) [verb]" format
5. **Explain significance** - Why does this matter? What changes?
6. **Add specifics** - Include concrete details appropriate for audience
7. **Review checklist** - Ensure all quality standards met

## Emergency Content Rules

If in doubt:
- **Always** lead with the finding
- **Always** include attribution
