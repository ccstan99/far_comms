# CONTENT GENERATION TASKS (conditionally called by data orchestrator)

research_resources_task:
  description: >
    Research and find actual URLs for the {speaker}'s PRIMARY resources - the main work they are presenting.
    This is for social media sharing (1 tweet), so focus on 1-4 most important resources only.
    
    <SLIDES>
    {slides_content}
    </SLIDES>

    SMART PRIORITY ORDER (should never fail):
    
    1. QR CODES/URLs FIRST if slides available:
       - If slides content is blank/empty: skip to step 2
       - Look for any URLs/links in the slides content above
       - If URLs found: these are the speaker's intended resources, verify and use them, STOP HERE
       - If no URLs found in slides: proceed to step 2
    
    2. TITLE + SPEAKER SEARCH (most reliable):
       - Query: "{talk_title} {speaker} paper" or "{speaker} {affiliation} {talk_title}"
       - This usually finds the main paper being presented
       - ONLY include if speaker is confirmed author/co-author
       - If 1+ quality speaker-authored resource found: STOP HERE
    
    3. SOCIAL MEDIA SEARCH (posts by speaker or co-authors about their work):
       - Single query: "{talk_title}" (site:x.com OR site:linkedin.com OR site:bsky.app)
       - Look for posts/threads by speaker OR co-authors about this work
       - ONLY include if: speaker is confirmed author AND post is by one of the authors
       - If 1+ quality social media resource found: STOP HERE
    
    4. SLIDES-INFORMED SEARCH (if slides available):
       - If slides content is blank/empty: STOP HERE 
       - Extract key terms/concepts from slides content above
       - Search with speaker name + key terms from slides
       - If 1+ good resource found: STOP HERE
       - If still nothing found: return blank/empty result
    
    EFFICIENCY RULES:
    - MAX 5 searches total 
    - Stop immediately when at least 1 quality resource found  
    - QR codes/URLs from slides HIGHEST priority (speaker's intended resources)
    - Title+Speaker search most reliable fallback
    - Academic conference publications > arxiv papers > speaker's social media posts > project websites > GitHub repos
    - OK to return empty if no speaker-authored resources found - quality over quantity
    - Better empty than generic resources that aren't directly related to the talk
    
    CRITICAL VALIDATION RULES:
    - MANDATORY: Speaker "{speaker}" MUST be listed as author/co-author on ALL papers
    - MANDATORY: Verify URLs actually work before including them
    - MANDATORY: If you cannot confirm speaker authorship, DO NOT include the resource
    - Do NOT include resources just because they match the topic - they must be speaker's work
    
    STRICT EXCLUSIONS:
    - Do NOT include general speaker homepages or CV
    - Do NOT include organization websites  
    - Do NOT include cited papers by other authors
    - Do NOT include comprehensive reference lists
    
  expected_output: >
    Simple format for Coda Resources column:
    "[Paper Title] - https://arxiv.org/abs/123"
    
    Maximum 1-4 lines. Focus on main academic/research resources only.
    Skip GitHub unless no papers or project websites found.
  agent: resource_researcher_agent

analyze_transcript_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the transcript to extract the {speaker}'s ({affiliation}) key ideas and points using their actual words and phrases.
    This analysis will be the foundation for downstream summarization and social media content generation.
    
    <TRANSCRIPT>
    {transcript_content}
    </TRANSCRIPT>
    
    DEPENDENCY CHECK: If transcript content is empty, very short (under 100 characters), or meaningless, return error message: "Cannot analyze empty or insufficient transcript content. Transcript processing failed or transcript is too short for analysis."
    
    <SLIDES>
    {slides_content}
    </SLIDES>
    
    CRITICAL: Use the speaker's exact words, phrases, and terminology wherever possible.
    
    Your analysis should:
    - Extract the speaker's main thesis using their own language
    - Capture key points in the speaker's voice and phrasing
    - Preserve the speaker's organizational structure and flow
    - Extract specific numbers, technical terms, and metrics exactly as stated
    - Find the most quotable/impactful statements in the speaker's words
    - Highlight surprising or counterintuitive claims using their exact phrasing
    - Capture any explicit CTAs, resource mentions, or directives from speaker
    - Extract summary/takeaway slides verbatim (perfect for social media)
    - Identify most tweetable content and social media ready quotes
    - Maintain technical accuracy while preserving authentic voice
    
  expected_output: >

# FINAL QUALITY CONTROL & ASSEMBLY

final_qa_task:
  description: >
    Final quality control, assembly, and approval for all content after evaluation pipeline.
    
    CONTEXT FIRST APPROACH: You receive ALL content through context from previous tasks.
    Extract content directly from the context provided by: resources, analysis, summaries, LinkedIn content, X + Bsky content, fact-checking results, and brand voice results.
    
    STRATEGIC QUESTIONS ONLY: Only ask questions to coworkers if you need:
    - Quality improvements or refinements to existing content
    - Clarification of technical accuracy concerns
    - Brand voice adjustments
    DO NOT ask for content that should already be available through context (resources, analysis, summaries, etc.)

    FINAL QA WORKFLOW:
    
    1. REVIEW EVALUATION RESULTS:
       - Check fact-checker accuracy score (must be ≥4/5)
       - Check brand voice compliance score (must be ≥4/5)
       - Review any corrections or improvements made
    
    2. ITERATIVE REFINEMENT (if needed):
       - If scores below threshold, identify specific issues
       - Delegate back to appropriate agents for refinement
       - Re-run evaluation pipeline on refined content
       - Continue until perfect quality achieved
    
    3. FINAL ASSEMBLY & APPROVAL:
       - Assemble complete LinkedIn and Twitter/X posts (content only - CTAs added in post-processing)
       - Perform final compliance audit against 14-point rubric
       - Make go/no-go publication decision
    
    CRITICAL PROHIBITIONS:
    - NEVER approve content with hashtags (immediate rejection)
    - All claims MUST match original transcript
