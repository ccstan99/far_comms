    transcript: 
    {transcript}
    ===
    Create compelling opening lines that:
    - LinkedIn: Appeal to policymakers, industry leaders, tech professionals
    - Twitter/X: Target ML researchers, AI alignment professionals
    - LEAD WITH THE CORE INSIGHT IMMEDIATELY - no setup or context
    - Start with concrete, specific, counterintuitive findings
    - Avoid corporate speak ("researchers discovered that", "new framework")
    - State the surprising result first, attribution second
    - Use active voice and direct statements
    - Be punchy and immediate - grab attention in first 5 words
    - Include brief reasoning for why each hook would capture attention
    - Provide variety: different angles, approaches, and emphasis

    SPEAKER: {speaker}
    AFFILIATION: {affiliation}
    ===
    Review the LinkedIn and Twitter/X content and fact check results from previous tasks.
    STEP 1 - FAR.AI BRAND VOICE:
    - Uses FAR.AI's conversational yet authoritative tone
    - Professional and credible, never mimicking speaker's personal style
    - Preserves speaker's exact technical terms and key insights for accuracy
    - Sounds like FAR.AI content, not a speaker quote
    - Maintains FAR.AI's brand consistency and standards
    
    STEP 2 - MAXIMUM CONCISENESS:
    - Cut every unnecessary word ruthlessly
    - Tighten sentence structure for maximum impact
    - LinkedIn: <150 words total, bullets ≤8 words each
    - Twitter/X: Maximize information density, eliminate fluff
    - Every word must earn its place - no exceptions
    
    IF CONTENT FAILS:
    1. Rewrite in FAR.AI's professional voice using factual content
    2. Cut wordiness aggressively while preserving meaning
    3. Re-assess both brand voice and conciseness
    4. Maximum 1 revision attempt to avoid loops

    Review the LinkedIn and Twitter/X content and all quality control results from previous tasks.
    STEP 1 - COMPLIANCE AUDIT:
    - Emoji usage (only 🔹 👇 ▶️ 📄 in designated places)
    - Character limits and word counts
    - Structural requirements (hook, paragraph, bullets, CTA)
    - Attribution and event mention rules
    - 14-point rubric scoring
    - Style guide violations
    
    STEP 2 - CONTENT ASSEMBLY:
    - Combine approved components using FAR.AI templates
    - LinkedIn: Hook + Paragraph + Bullets + CTA + First Comment
    - Twitter/X: Optimized content + CTA with links
    - Apply proper formatting and structure
    
    IF COMPLIANCE FAILS:
    1. Fix format violations (emojis, structure, character counts)
    2. Re-audit against style guide requirements
