    - Remove unnecessary words while preserving speaker's voice
    - Tighten sentence structure for maximum impact
    - LinkedIn: Target <200 words, bullets <10 words each
    - Twitter/X: Maximize information density
    - Cut fluff while maintaining speaker's authentic style
    
    IF CONTENT FAILS:
    1. Fix voice issues using speaker's actual phrases from transcript
    2. Cut wordiness while preserving authentic voice
    3. Re-assess both voice match and conciseness

    Review the LinkedIn and Twitter/X content and all quality control results from previous tasks.
    STEP 1 - COMPLIANCE AUDIT:
    - Emoji usage (only 🔹 👇 ▶️ 📄 in designated places)
    - Character limits and word counts
    - Structural requirements (hook, paragraph, bullets, CTA)
    - Attribution and event mention rules
    - 14-point rubric scoring
