    Process and clean slide content for speaker: {speaker}
    
    RAW SLIDES CONTENT:
    {slides_raw}
    
    QR CODES FOUND:
    {qr_codes}
    
    VISUAL ELEMENTS:
    {visual_elements}
    
    SOURCE FILE: {pdf_path}
    
    Your processing should:
    - PRESERVE ALL ORIGINAL SLIDE TEXT VERBATIM - do not summarize, paraphrase, or rewrite
    - Clean and structure the provided slide content while keeping exact wording
    - Preserve all technical terminology, formulas, and acronyms exactly as written
    - Maintain the original slide structure and organization
    - SKIP decorative visual elements: logos, profile photos, generic images unless they contain important content
    - Mark important visual elements only: [chart: description] for data charts, [diagram: description] for technical diagrams
    - Include QR codes from the QR CODES FOUND section as verified resources
    - If any slides appear missing from the raw content, note this in processing_notes
    - Extract and catalog MAIN WORK resources only (not comprehensive bibliography):
      * QR code URLs (high priority - intentionally shared by speaker)
      * Primary research paper being presented (usually in title/main slides)
      * Key datasets or codebases that are the focus of the talk
      * SKIP: speaker homepages, institution links, extensive reference lists, related work citations
    - Identify slide titles, main sections, and organizational structure

    Clean and format transcript for speaker: {speaker}
    
    RAW TRANSCRIPT (SRT format from AssemblyAI):
    {transcript_raw}
    
    SOURCE: {transcript_source}
    SLIDES CONTEXT (from previous task for technical accuracy):
    Use the slides content from the previous task to ensure name spelling and technical terms are correct.

    TRANSCRIPT STYLE GUIDE:
    {style_transcript}
    ---
    
    CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - FAILURE TO FOLLOW WILL RESULT IN REJECTION:
    1. WORD COUNT VALIDATION: Your output must contain 95-105% of the original word count
    2. VERBATIM PRESERVATION: Keep EVERY SINGLE WORD from the original transcript
    3. ONLY ALLOWED CHANGES: Fix spelling/terminology using style guide, add paragraph breaks
    4. FORBIDDEN ACTIONS: Do NOT remove, summarize, shorten, or paraphrase ANY content
    5. FORBIDDEN ACTIONS: Do NOT add section headers, titles, or structural elements
    
    Processing steps:
    1. Extract text from SRT format (ignore timestamps - preserved automatically)
    2. Count words in original text and log this number
    3. Apply transcript style guide corrections ONLY for spelling/terminology
    4. Use slide context for technical term accuracy
    5. Organize into paragraphs (50-100 words) at natural topic transitions
    6. Count words in final output - MUST be within 95-105% of original count
    7. If word count drops below 95%, you have failed the task - try again

research_resources_task:
  description: >
    Research and find actual URLs for the PRIMARY resources identified in slides (not comprehensive bibliography).
    
    Use only the MAIN WORK resources from the previous slide processing task - typically 1-2 resources max.
    
    Your research should focus on:
    - QR code URLs (high priority):
      * These URLs are already verified - do NOT search for them
      * Visit the URL to get the page title and determine resource type (paper, codebase, website, dataset)
      * Extract basic info: type, title, url (keep original QR URL)
    - Primary research paper being presented:
      * Search using queries like "[paper title] [conference] [year]", "[paper title] arXiv"  
      * Look for arXiv preprints, official conference proceedings, ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore
      * Try variations with author names + key terms from talk title
    - Key datasets/codebases that are the main focus:
      * Only if they are central to the work being presented
    
    STRICT EXCLUSIONS:
    - Do NOT search for social media posts
    - Do NOT include speaker homepages or institutional links
    - Do NOT include related work or comprehensive reference lists
    - Do NOT include background/citation papers
    
    Expected result: 0-2 resources typically, max 4 for multi-paper presentations
    Format: simple text format, NO emojis, one resource per line

final_assembly_task:
  description: >
    Assemble all processed content and prepare final outputs for Coda database update.
    
    Extract the ACTUAL content from previous tasks:
    - Slides: Use "cleaned_slides" content from slide processing task (if not skipped)
    - Resources: Use "resources_formatted" string from resource research task  
    - SRT: Use "transcript_srt" content (with timestamps) from transcript processing task (if not skipped)
    - Transcript: Use "transcript_formatted" content (clean paragraphs) from transcript processing task (if not skipped)
    - Generate processing summary for "Webhook progress" column
    - Set "Webhook status" to "Done"
    
    IMPORTANT: For any skipped content, do NOT include those fields in coda_updates.
    Only include fields for content that was actually processed (not skipped).
